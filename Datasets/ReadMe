The R Notebook file DataLoading.rmd shows an example of loading a scRNA-seq dataset using the Bioconductor R 
open-source software. The installation code for the Bioconductor libraries used in the notebook are found in:
https://bioconductor.org/packages/3.19/bioc/
The full list of scRNA-seq datasets stored by Bioconductor as well as the code to load them into R 
can be found here: https://bioconductor.org/packages/devel/data/experiment/manuals/scRNAseq/man/scRNAseq.pdf
In our study we employ very simple and common processing to the loaded dataset using Bioconductor commands. 
For details on the purpose and mechanism of these commands see: Orchestrating Single-Cell Analysis with 
Bioconductor by Amezquita et al (https://bioconductor.org/books/3.12/OSCA/). 
After applying PCA to the processed dataset we compute the variance and the mean vector for every cell cluster
per sample on the reduced space. This information along withthe cluster proportions relative to their samples 
and number of cells per cluster are stored in a list to be fed to the Matlab code. Two examples of formatted 
data are:
- baronpc: Baron Pancreas dataset. It has 4 real samples.
- segerSL: This dataset includes 20 simulated samples (10 for each class of patient healthy vs type 2 diabetes).
