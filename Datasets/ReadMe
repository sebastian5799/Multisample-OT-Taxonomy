The R Notebook file DataLoading.rmd shows an example of loading a scRNA-seq dataset using the Bioconductor R Package.
The full list of scRNA-seq datasets found in this package as well as the code to load them can be found here:
https://bioconductor.org/packages/devel/data/experiment/manuals/scRNAseq/man/scRNAseq.pdf
In the file we employ very simple and common processing of the dataset. For more details and other complicated tools that process the data see:
Orchestrating Single-Cell Analysis with Bioconductor by Amezquita et al (https://bioconductor.org/books/3.12/OSCA/). After applying PCA to the 
processed dataset we compute the variance and the mean vector for every cell cluster per sample on the reduced space. This information along with
the cluster proportions relative to their samples and number of cells per cluster are stored in a list.
