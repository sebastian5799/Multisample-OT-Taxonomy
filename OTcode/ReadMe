A description of the files in this folder:
* OT.m is the function code that implements Optimal Transport.
* otrmcl1.m is the function code that implements Optimal Transport with marginal constraints. 
* CostMat.m is a the function that computes a cost matrix between 2 samples. It uses the Wasserstein distance.
* OT_SA.mlx is a Matlab notebook with details and code on how to build a taxonomy using regular OT.
* OT_RMC.mlx is a Matlab notebook with details on how to build a taxonomy using OTRMC. This is
  our proposed method
* ClassifySample.mlx is a Matlab notebook with details and code on how to use taxonomy to classify samples.
* baseTax.m is a Matlab script that uses  OT.m and otrmcl1.m for Reference Aligment. We use this approach as 
  a baseline for which to compare our method. 

The OT.m and otrmcl1.m functions make use the MOSEK optimization software. The download page of this
