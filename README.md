![taxonomy_plos](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/3b94b0ba-b83b-46db-89bb-c56cabc2a5b2)

The Datasets folder contains the R code for loading the scRNA-seq data sets from Bioconductor package.
The OTcode folder contains:
* Functions for Optimal Transport and Optimal Transport with Marginal Constraints
* Sample formatted dataset. See Data folder for how to generate data. 
* Two Matlab scripts that implement OT and OT-RMC functions to generate the taxonomies
* Matlab script to implement random forest to predict sample class using the built taxonomy
